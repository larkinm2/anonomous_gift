Anonomous Gift is an app used to connect underprivlidged children to anonymous gifts. 

Nonprofits can logon and create anonomous gifts. The gifts should say who the gift is going to (Ex: Male 14 years old) and what type of gits they want to recieve (Ex: Socks). 

Anonymous donors can logon and select a gift. After selecting, they can claim a gift fron an organization. By claiming the gift is deleted from the main page, and an email is sent to the nonprofit that posted it telling them to expect the gift.
